# When-I-see-places

What it's about?
-Travel views with a budget. The pictures are taken as I go on my phone. Motivation is related towarards team economyclass. For now an instagram page has already been setup.

Where it would be going?
-To communicate with like minded travellers, sharing pictures as they go. 

Inspiration:
-While travelling I've met locals from different regions, who would love to travel but think that can't be done. With this website I would like to help people meet their travelling desires. 
eg: One of my uber driver here in the states always wanted to travel to Australia but never did. 
Question here would be? What can we do to make it possible.
